# DATA LIT - DATA VISUALIZATION

This work is part of the homework assignement of the "DATA VISUALIZATION" of the "DATA LIT" course. In this notebook I analyzed Breast Cancer(Diagnostic) Analysis.

In order to visualizate data i have usen seaborn plots and for diversity of plots. I use violin plot and swarm plot. Is very nice plots as i tried to use it for visualization.

## Violin plot : 

A violin plot is a art of seaborn. A violin plot plays a similar role as a box and whisker plot. It shows the distribution of quantitative data across several levels of one (or more) categorical variables such that those distributions can be compared.


## Swarm Plot :

A swarm plot is  part of seaborn. This style of plot is sometimes called a “beeswarm”. A swarm plot can be drawn on its own, but it is also a good complement to a box or violin plot in cases where we want to show all observations along with some representation of the underlying distribution.

This two plots are very nice as i tried.....
